   - two things to remember

new
 - first scenario: walking skeleton
 - possibility of non-automated approach
 - workflow vs actor layer

technology possibilities
 - hand-rolled
 - fit
 - twist
 - cucumber

projections of notional, abstract form of application
 - code
 - unit tests
 - documentation
 - marketing
 - acceptance tests
stories describe delta to abstract form

what you leave out of your tests is as important as what you put in

collaboration in defining scenarios
 - tools (e.g. twist, cucumber) can be used to help this
 - or through discussion and just use code

software design
 - layering
 - model application
 - set-up code
   - needs to be very efficient
   - declarative (and therefore intelligent)
   - can cheat if necessary
 - (nearly) all set-up in single test

use scenarios to define whole process
 - agree with business
 - frame development of app in terms of elaboration of scenarios
 - base scenarios on activities you want your software to support
 - ba, testers, devs should all agree on scenarios and know which
   scenarios a story affects

scenario tests are just (yet another) projection
they *may* be readable by analysts, business, but they aren't a
requirements doc (not complete)

pitfalls of acceptance testing
 - too many
 - slow
 - hard to maintain
 - fragile
 - have to keep changing

what level to control system at?
 - end-to-end
 - exercise integration points?
 - use real transports?
 - through UI?
 - in/out of container?
 - simulators

tensions
 - speed
 - readability
 - impression of application and what is important
 - coverage
 - completeness
 - maintenance effort
 - reliability
